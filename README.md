# Survival Prediction for Cirrhosis Patients

This repository contains the code and analysis for the project aimed at predicting the survival of cirrhosis patients using machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset used in this study is sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI).

## Dataset

The dataset includes 17 clinical features of cirrhosis patients and is utilized to predict patient survival. Detailed information about the dataset and its features can be found at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cirrhosis).

## Analysis and Model

For a comprehensive explanation of the data preprocessing, analysis, and model development and selection, refer to the provided PDF document in the repository (`Informe Pr√†ctica IAA - Cai Selvas Sala.pdf`).

## Python and Library Requirements

The project is developed using Python 3.x. All dependencies required to run the project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file included in the repository.
